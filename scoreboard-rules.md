# Quint Scoreboard Rules

We appreciate the efforts of our peers for going through our minimal viable
solution and generating excellent suggestions for
improvement. To reflect this, we are collecting four kinds of scores at the
[scoreboard][] on the main page[^1].

## Learning the language [earth :earth_africa:]

The tutorials contain secret codes that you can submit, in order to get
:earth_africa: scores. Either submit a secret code in a DM to @konnov (if you
know how to reach him), or create a secret [gist](https://gist.github.com/),
write your secret code in the gist and mention @konnov there.

## Github contributions [air :cyclone:]

 - A few-line fix in the documentation: **3** :cyclone:

 - A confirmed bug report for something that has a simple fix: **5**
   :cyclone:

 - A confirmed bug report that has no simple fix: **10**
   :cyclone:

 - A confirmed bug report that leads to language refactoring: **20** :cyclone:

## Examples [water :ocean:]

Contributing a non-trivial example to the repository brings you from **10** to
**50** :ocean: scores, depending on the quality of a contribution. In general,
we prefer concise and well-thought examples that demonstrate nice features of
Quint, not just replicating code in other programming languages.

## Non-standard contributions [fire :fire:]

No rules. Non-standard contributions are very much appreciated too. We assign
bonus scores :fire: to them on a whim :smile_cat:

[^1]: *Do not take these scores too seriously, they are not an objective
reward (like money). It is just a way to make learning the language a bit more
fun*.
